            <p style="padding:20px 20px;background-color:rgb(255, 123, 71);font-size: 20px"> My name is Md. Rahimuzzaman Bhuiyan.
                Currently I am a fourth
                year Computer Science and Engineering student studying in Ulab (University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh).
                Since my early days I have been very interested in technology. That's why I want to pursue my BSc degree
                in
                computer science. The journey to achieve this degree is not easy, there are a lot of difficulties but I
                really
                enjoy overcoming the obstacles relevant to my study.
                I have done my SSC from BCSIR high school and HSC from Birshrestha Munshi Abdur Rouf Public College. In
                both
                board exams I have achieved GPA 5 from the science group. My home town is Dhaka and currently I live
                here.
                I really love cycling, swimming, reading novels, and visiting libraries during my free time. I really
                love my
                parents. My father was a commercial officer in GMPPL company and my mother is a housewife. My mother is
                a good
                home tutor.
                I really enjoyed doing my home study under my mother's supervision during my primary school days. I like
                to
                attend many different kinds of competitions like math olympiad, science fair, language competition etc.
                The
                reason behind attending this kind of competition is I want to communicate more with new people to share
                and
                expand my knowledge and this kind of platform helps me most.
                I have some achievements from these competitions. Among them the notable one is that I have stood first
                in the
                Higher Secondary Level Science fair competition that was held in my college in 2015. I love to swim very
                much
                and I have a desire that one day I will cross the Bangla channel by swimming in the future.
